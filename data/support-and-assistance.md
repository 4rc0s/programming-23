The official course support channels are available through Discord. Course instructors will be on standby **from September 7th 2021 onwards**.

#### Discord

Discord is a communication platform which allows both text-based and voice/video chats. You can find out more about the platform [on the Discord website](https://discord.com/).

The course channels are available through [this link](https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/discord/join/ohjelmointi21). See especially the `ohjelmointi21_english` and the `ohjelmointi21_voice` channels for support in English.

#### Support practices

A team of course instructors is available on multiple days every week to help you with your programming-related questions. Instructors will be on standby on the Discord channels at the times specified in the table below. They will also reply to queries sent via private messages at those times. Please be mindful of their time - do not send private messages outside the times listed below.

In the table below the letter `T` means instructors are only available on the text-based channels `ohjelmointi21_general` and `ohjelmointi21_english`. The letter `V` means instructors are available both on the text-based channels and on the voice channel `ohjelmointi21_voice`.
