## Taking part in an exam

You may take part in any of the exams listed above once you have completed the required number of exercises. Specifically, you must have received 25% of the exercise points for each round on the course by 8 AM on the morning of the exam. If any of the rounds falls under this limit, your exam submission will not be graded.

Submissions are graded separately for the Introduction to Programming course (parts 1-7) and the Advanced Course in Programming (parts 8-14).

You may take part in more than one of the exams listed above. The best result is registered.

## Exercise points

Each programming exercise and quiz in each part is worth a number of exercise points. You can find a list of all the exercises in each part by clicking on the "List of exercises in this part" menu on the index page of each part. You can see your current exercise points by clicking on the blue blob in the bottom right corner of any page in the material. The percentage in the "Total points" section is the critical one for passing the course.
